# Umbraco : More Info App

This is a sample content app which has a simple preview frame along with some data about the content that is currently being edited.

It's used as reference for the 24 days in Umbraco article 'Make your custom back-end lovely'.

## Custom styling

To see the content app without using the core umbraco styling check out the [unstyled branch](https://github.com/Rockerby/24d_Package/tree/unstyled).
